<h1>HTML이란 무엇인가?</h1>

<P>Curious by nature, I love connecting with and understanding people. I get jazzed leading in-depth user research and brainstorming solutions. <strong> 내 힘은 내가 정해! </strong> Collaboration and teamwork are my jam.
Previously, I was working on the core product at Box. Before diving into enterprise design, I did the digital-nomad thing traveling the world solo as a freelance designer.
Prior to that I was a UX designer at Vertigo, which was acquired by MLB Media. While at UC Berkeley I studied design-thinking and the mind, but design and code first found its way into my life during the golden era of Neopets.<P>I'm always trying to grow and learn something new.</P><P style="margin-top:40px"> I lose track of time when I'm hand-lettering, backpacking over mountains</P>

<P>Currently, I'm not looking for new opportunities, but I am open to fun side projects.</P> <P>Please don't hesitate to reach out— I'm happy to chat about work or play!</P>
